# Gradient Boosting Classifier for Sentiment Analysis

This project implements the gradient boosting algorithm from scratch for sentiment analysis on the Sentiment140 dataset. The goal is to classify tweets as positive or negative.

## Project Description

Gradient boosting is a powerful machine learning technique used for regression and classification problems. This project demonstrates the core concepts of gradient boosting using decision trees as base learners, without all the optimizations that XGBoost includes.

## Dataset

The Sentiment140 dataset consists of 1.6 million tweets labeled with positive or negative sentiments. You can download the dataset [here](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip).

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Then run:

```bash
python main.py
